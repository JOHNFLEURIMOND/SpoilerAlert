 The code is written in Javascript and I used Nodemon to display data from a function in the terminal. 

## My Awesome Project 

My task was to take in a list of refrigerator contents and return a list containing weight by
category of expired contents to be composted. Below is a list of smell scores by category and
an example of refrigerator contents.
Category smell limits


● Produce expires at an 8 or above

● Dairy expires at a 5 or above

● Meat expires at a 6 or above

Example refrigerator contents
1. 2.2 lbs of produce with a smell score of 0 (fresh)
2. 1.4 lbs of dairy with a smell score of 4 (fresh)
3. 1.5 lbs of produce with a smell score if 8 (expired)
4. 0.75 lbs of meat with a smell score of 6 (expired)
5. 0.55 lbs of snacks with a smell score of 9 (fresh)
6. 4.8 lbs of frozen with a smell score of 10 (expired)
7. 0.8 lbs of produce with a smell score of 10 (expired)

In this example, the contents should evaluate to

● Meat: 0.75

● Frozen: 4.8

● Produce: 2.3


Write a function that can receive contents and return the total weight of each expired category.
Include some code that calls the function with the example input above and print the results.

# How To Get It Started :arrow_forward: :

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

The code will run in the terminal once started and return the data from the function provided in Node.js
